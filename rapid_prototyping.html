   <h3>RAPID PROTOTYPING</h3>
  <p> Design verification at S-CUBE can be as simple as sculpted clay and foam models or as detailed as a high level,
   non-linear finite element analysis.
   
Regardless of the client’s needs, we offer the latest cutting edge technologies to check form, fit, function, structural integrity, and manufacturability. This includes verifying that the type of material will meet the needs of the project; the product will function as intended, debugging any issues and optimizing the design.<br><br>
Rather than spend weeks or months analyzing design intent prior to verification, S-CUBE believes that the faster a bench model or prototype can be produced the better-even if the product design has not been completely finalized. Once an obvious direction is chosen, we begin building a 3D parametric database for the product or process.<br><br> 
The protoyping at a rapid speed helps reduce the development and manufacturing cycle. We can help you in converting your design into funtional and non-functional models.This helps small desing and engineering cocerns to test more ideas in less cost and time to come up with right design. For large companies is a way to hone ideas before 
presenting them to superiors. These concept models are valuable and efffective communication tools for conveying ideas to clients and marketers in a cost effective way. Functional prototype give more realistic view in terms of look, feel and functionality.<br><br>
Regardless of your industry, if you need to verify your designs, and need a cost-efficient model or prototype quickly, with or without a high-degree of accuracy or a well-defined finishing degree then we can help you geeting the work done.With the given expertize we help our client to design iteratively to develop flawless product, finding fixing problem early in
 design cycle to reduce
 rework and provide physical models (concept and functional) to convey ideas in a better way.<br><br>
