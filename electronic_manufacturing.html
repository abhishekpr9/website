	<h3><strong>DESIGN</strong> </h3>
	<p>Design services encompass several related actions that occur after determining a customer's specifications or product needs and before manufacturing
	or assembly takes place.We first provide  preliminary specifications then do research by 
	interviewing product users, consulting experts, and exploring existing related products.  
	After these two steps occur, the product is then developed, visualized, and tested.
